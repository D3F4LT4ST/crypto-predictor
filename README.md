# Cryptocurrency price movement forecasting with machine learning
This project explores the question of whether the advanced machine learning models are cabable of producing better than naive (no change in price) short-term forecasts for cryptocurrency prices. The null hypothesis is that the price fluctuations are completely unpredictable, and that any model's accuracy will eventually converge to 50% as the test set grows in size.
